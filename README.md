# database_web_app
This web app was designed to provide quick and secure access to databsae tables from a browser.  I use this web app to make updates to the database for monthly reporting requirements.  The app utilizes cookie authentication to ensure the user is signed in before accessing the database information.  The user then has access to make changes to specific database tables.
